## Information About Me 
Here is some information about me:
I am a student completing my BSC in Cyber Security at Leeds Beckett University and aspire for a career within the cyber security sector. 
As part of my course, I am developing my computer programming skills, educating myself in how to use GitHub; therefore, I am creating a repository to monitor my progress and demonstrate my programming skills.
